# LSB watermarking sensor data
A solution to write LSB watermarks into sensor data from DS18B20 digital temperature sensor. 

This repository is part of a university software project. It was intended to find the best way of hiding data as LSB watermarks within the temperature data of the DS18B20 digital temperature sensor. For that, we measured the temperature in a room with a constant temperature to see how accurate the sensor is in measuring the room's temperature. After that, we determined the standard deviation of all values and how the insertion of different kinds of LSB watermarks affects the overall standard deviation.
